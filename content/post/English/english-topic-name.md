**Does your name have a special meaning?**

Funny you ask. My name is made up of three Chinese characters. The second character is actually the abbreviation for Hunan, which is my dad's hometown. 

The third character linked to lotus seeds. You konw, Hunan is known as the home of the lotus flower.

In Chinese culture, lotus seeds stand for purity and strength, like a lotus blooming through muddy waters while staying flawless. 

They also symbolize family blessings. The many seeds in one pod mean abundant love and generations of prosperity.

And to me personally, it also reflects inner peace—just as the seed grows patiently toward light, it reminds me to stay calm and true to myself.

**How would you choose names for your next generation?**

When choosing names for the next generation, I'd definitely want something meaningful, and also make sure it sounds good and fits well with our last name. It’s a big decision, so I’d discuss it with my partner to find the perfect name together.

**Are there any differences between how Chinese name their children now and in the past?**

In the past, Chinese names were often chosen based on traditional texts and family lineage, with a strong emphasis on generational names and auspicious meanings. Nowadays, parents are more open to unique, creative names, sometimes inspired by popular culture or even Western influences, while still valuing positive connotations. 

**Does anyone in your family have the same name as you?**

Nope, nobody in my family has the same name as me. Actually, the third character in my name is pretty rare. I've never met anyone else who uses it in their name.

**Are there any names that are more popular than others in China?**

Oh definitely, this topic is right up my alley. Recently in China, names like "Zihan" and "Zixuan" have been all the rage among children. You just walk around the school campus and you'll bump into several. A few decades ago, though names among my grandparents like "Jianguo" and "Yongqiang" were literally a dime a dozen and they really packed a punch compared to today's more elegant names.
